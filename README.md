# my-nvim-config
This repository contains my Neovim configuration. The config 
provides full LSP support, debugging with a configurable UI, built-in compiler for each language and some useful snippets to make your code writing faster. The plugin manager is lazy.nvim. The config is inspired by various other configs i found on the site.
To install it just clone the repo into your .config and name the folder "nvim". Then run :so on the init.lua file and follow it up with :Lazy. Restart your Neovim and you are good to go ðŸ™‚.

# my-nvim-config
This repository contains my Neovim configuration. The config 
provides full LSP support, debugging with a configurable UI, built-in compiler for each language and some useful snippets to make code writing faster. 

Plugin manager : Packer.nvim

The config installs automatically when you open Neovim. All you have to do is run these commands: 

```
cd .config
git clone "https://github.com/wienio03/my-nvim-config.git" nvim
```
